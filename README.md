# You aren't in a chat.

Quick filter to remove annoying system message spam without disabling the entire event. Maybe one day it will be a more dynamic blacklist who knows. Probably not though...

## Motivation

I got spammed by "You aren't in a party." system message all the time and had no clue how to fix it...
